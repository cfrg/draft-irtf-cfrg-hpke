In `DHKEM(P-521, HKDF-SHA512)`, the KDF is `HKDF-SHA512` with the hash function `SHA512`, which has output length 64 bytes.\r\n\r\nThus, as one of the possibilities mentioned by @kjacobs-moz , `Nzz` is based on the HKDF-Extract output length. That is because HKDF-Extract is exactly _one_ call to HMAC and returns its result; HMAC's output length is the output length of the underlying hash function. HKDF-Expand has variable output length, that is why it would not make sense to define Nzz via HKDF-Expand's output length, but rather we need to define HKDF-Expand's output length by Nzz.\r\n\r\nWhile a P-521 DH shared secret might justify, from a security level point of view, a KEM shared secret a bit longer than 64 bytes, I believe it is beneficial to keep it at 64 bytes because then HKDF-Expand is exactly _one_ call to HMAC. With 66 bytes, or 65 bytes, we would need an entire second call to HMAC, only to gain one byte. Also, because the KeySchedule continues with SHA512 as well, we do not benefit from the slightly higher security level, I think.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe we should keep the 64 as it is.\r\n\r\nHaving written this, I admit that it took me a bit to understand what we meant with the sentence \u201cand the output length of the KDF's Extract function is Nzz bytes\u201d. While it is clearly true for the specified variants of DHKEM, it is a confusing formulation. Maybe we can come up with something better.

Section 5 says:\r\n> A \"context\" encodes the AEAD algorithm and key in use, and manages the nonces used so that the same nonce is not used with multiple plaintexts.\r\n\r\nBut it also has an exporter secret. Then section 5.1 says:\r\n> return Context(key, nonce, exporter_secret)\r\n\r\nBut we haven't defined the `Context` function yet. I'm guessing the intent is that `Context` produces some sort of record type with those field names? But that wouldn't initialize `Context.seq` used later in 5.2. (Confusingly, this `Context` is distinct from the `context` variable which contains an `HPKEContext` structure. Maybe the latter could be renamed?)\r\n\r\nThen 5.2 lists out the contents of a \"context' more explicitly, including the first mention of a sequence number. But it omits the exporter secret again. (Should \"The sender's context MUST be used for encryption only. Similarly, the recipient's context MUST be used for decryption only.\" be rephrased? One could read that as saying export is also not okay.)\r\n\r\nThen 5.3 mentions a context having an \"exporter secret\", but this is actually the only instance of that phrase in the document.",

Although we understand that a full proof of post-quantum security may not be achievable within the timeline of this draft's publication, we would nevertheless recommend some additional discussion on what might be desirable to prove.  In the draft, the PSK is employed as an authentication factor, so presumably the proof being contemplated would be that authentication in the modes involving PSKs remains secure against a quantum computer.  A stronger property would be more attractive:  that encryption in the PSK modes remains secure against a quantum computer, whether the KEM itself is post-quantum or not.  If the authors consider this property plausible, then it should be mentioned here as a goal for security analysis.  If not, then the reasons for not targeting this property should also be given.\r\n\r\n",

So we should indeed add this as a desired security property, with pretty much the same reasoning as employed by WireGuard, see [Section 5.2 in the WireGuard whitepaper](https://hyp.is/eMrNnKHTEeqR-TeuWEsFDA/www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Authentication provided by PSK in quantum setting\r\nIn the same way, the analysis shows that authentication remains if KEM keys are compromised, or if the PSK is compromised but not the KEM keys.\r\n\r\nSo, in a way, this is just about discussing desired security properties in different compromise cases, where certain compromise cases are especially relevant because of quantum adversaries.\r\n\r\n### Minor nit\r\nBy the way, in [Security Properties](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke.md#security-properties-sec-properties), we should add that the PSK mode is also providing sender authentication.\r\n```\r\nSender authentication: Proof of sender origin for Auth and AuthPSK modes\r\n```\r\nLater, in [Metadata Protection](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke.md#metadata-protection), PSK mode is correctly listed as authenticated mode.\r\n```\r\nThe authenticated modes of HPKE (PSK, Auth, AuthPSK) require [\u2026]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll try to find time to draft a pull request.",

RFC7748 defines \"curve25519\" as a particular Montgomery curve. It then defines \"X25519\" as a Diffie-Hellman primitive on top of curve25519, with particular encodings and everything else. HPKE is using the Diffie-Hellman primitive, so it should use X25519. As a bonus, it's shorter and \"DHKEM(Curve25519, HKDF-SHA256)\" is already a mouthful. :-)",

Specifically, there's\r\n```\r\nKeySchedule(info, psk, pskID):\r\n    LabeledExtract(..., info)\r\n    LabeledExtract(..., psk)\r\n    LabeledExtract(..., pskID)\r\nContext.Export(exporter_context):\r\n    LabeledExpand(..., exporter_context, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there were a (reasonably small) upper bound on the sizes of `info`, `psk`, `pskID`, and `exporter_context`, then it would be trivial to implement HPKE without allocation.\r\n\r\nI've thought about \"streaming\" the input into the above functions, instead of sending a concatenated bytestring. This could theoretically work for HKDF-Extract with SHA256, since it's an MD hash, but this doesn't work generically. Also the definition of HKDF-Expand does not admit a way to stream in the `info` string.",

It's true that having both `DeriveKeyPair` and `GenerateKeyPair` is a larger definition of KEM in HPKE, but, realistically, everyone has a `GenerateKeyPair` in their existing KEM-like APIs, while `DeriveKeyPair` is the more niche operation. After all, we've managed to use DH thus far *somehow*. :-) From the context of HPKE's use in ECH in TLS, I'm not sure `DeriveKeyPair` would be needed at all. `DeriveKeyPair(random())` is also going to result in many more hash calls than a typical `GenerateKeyPair` implementation.",

Maybe worth saying that.\r\n2. p5: I2OSP and OS2IP aren't expanded here - be no harm to do so\r\n3. p6: Open as the opposite of Seal, doesn't seem like the best choice - there are too many functions called open() in too many contexts. Unseal would be better IMO.\r\n4. p5: DeriveKeyPair was added after discussion in github (and maybe on the MLS list) but I don't recall any disussion of that on the CFRG list at all. Was there any? Adding this seems fine to me if MLS wants it and the definition is also almost fine (see above) so this is just a process nit.\r\n5. p5 & elsewhere: \"fixed-length\" is used in various places where it's not quite true - the various lengths are fixed only after you pick a ciphersuite - so people's code has to support different sizes (if they support >1 suite)\r\n\r\nMy take on each of these is:\r\n\r\n1. We can clarify this.\r\n2. These seem fairly common in folded form and are quite a mouthful when expanded, so I'm inclined to keep these as is.\r\n3. Open and seal seem fairly common, at least in APIs I'm familiar with (BoringSSL/OpenSSL, libsodium, NaCL, etc), so I'm inclined to keep this as is.\r\n4. I disagree about this being a process nit. The document is still an active RG document, so everything is subject to change. I'm not sure why discussion would be needed before or after it lands in the document?\r\n5. Similar to other stacks I'm familiar with, I assume memory would statically allocated for each of these fixed-length values (on the stack) based on the maximum size supported. The specific ciphersuite/length would then use however much of that memory is needed. So this seems fine to keep, though perhaps clarifying might help? I'm not sure what that would look like right now, but I'll give it some thought.",

I think the intention is to interpret \"\"  \r\nas 'nil', i.e., no salt, but the empty string is certainly a valid salt for\r\nHKDF, since the extraction function is well-defined on this input.

In fact, it's used every time the \"Seal()\" or \"Open()\"\r\noperation is run. What's called a \"nonce\" here is usually called the\r\n\"initialization vector\" elsewhere: in TLS 1.3 for example, the \"nonce\" is the\r\ninitialization vector XORed with a sequence number.    \r\n\r\n(Edit: from the list, consider renaming this to \"iv\")",

The primary reason someone might want this is if they were migrating from one HPKE library to another, and wanted to keep their long-term private keys the same. Currently, a user would have to dig into both implementations to find their internal representation and figure out how to convert between the two manually. The fact that go-hpke and rust-hpke have (I think) the same byte representation of secret keys is good, but it would be better if this were guaranteed by the spec.\r\n\r\nI propose `SerializeSk/DeserializeSk` functions (not married to those names) that do what you'd expect, with the small addition that `DeserializeSk` should reject secret keys that are equivalent to 0.\r\n\r\n**Addendum**\r\n\r\nI also think that `SerializeSk` should canonicalize secret keys. For P-curves, this would mean reducing modulo the curve order, and for X25519/X448 this would mean clamping the keys.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think we should do this is because users might want to save their secret keys using some storage mechanism of their choosing. They might have some expectations of secret key identity (e.g., as a key in a table or an item in a set), and it would be a lot more effort to scream \"equivalent keys are not identical!\" all across our docs than to just make sure that equivalent keys actually are identical.",

So it would be incumbent upon the user to keep their IKM around even if they had no current plans to migrate.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could require that secret keys also retain their seed IKM, but the actual problem here is assuming that IKM is safe to store indefinitely. Since there's no assumption on the pseudorandomness of the IKM (it just needs enough entropy), there might be some sensitive information in there which could be related to other secrets elsewhere (e.g., the IKM is a password that's partially or fully reused for some other service). Since `DeriveKeyPair()` uses a KDF, this isn't a problem if you store just the resulting secret key.\r\n\r\nThus, I think it makes it easier to Do The Right Thing if secret keys are serializable and we can throw away IKMs as soon as we KDF them.",

          "body": "Hi Chris,\r\n\r\nHPKE combines a key exchange mechanism with encryption.\r\n\r\nHowever, it could be useful in a broader range of applications and protocols if it could be used only for key exchange, delegating the encryption part to applications.\r\n\r\nHaving standardized suites (which include an AEAD) is a no brainer for ensuring interoperability between application solely depending on HPKE for hybrid key encryption.\r\n\r\nBut it is a limitation for other protocols that already use more than HPKE. Actual examples:\r\n\r\n- Permutation-based AEADs using a rolling state (such as Xoodyak) don\u2019t fit in the HPKE model that increments a nonce after each message. However, they could still benefit from HPKE to absorb keying material.\r\n- Existing high-level protocols and APIs for stream encryption (taking care of rekeying, and out of band signalisation) could leverage HPKE as a key exchange mechanism.\r\n- In the context of a crypto library or a standard library, users will expect such a mechanism to be compatible with anything a uniform shared secret could be useful for. Including AEADs that can be better suited than AES depending on the context.\r\n\r\nA protocol will not have any interoperability issues if the key exchange mechanism and the AEAD (or anything else) are defined separately.\r\n\r\nRegistering new IANA identifiers is not a practical option for most cases. Higher-level protocols (especially application-specific ones) don\u2019t have their place in a global namespace. And even at a primitive level, while using AEGIS or GIFT-COFB as an AEAD could be justified by application requirements, having these in the IANA database would probably be unwanted.\r\n\r\nApplications will inevitably either use custom versions of HPKE, or mix and match NOISE and HPKE just to fit the set of AEADs and encryption operations currently supported by HPKE. \r\n\r\nSo, in order to encourage reusability and make HPKE also useful beyond the current encryption API, my proposal would be to reserve an AEAD identifier for protocol-defined use of the shared key, nonce, or exporter secret. Such identifier might be followed by a label in order to provide domain separation.\r\n",

          "body": "Thanks for the detailed description. If I understand right, these are examples that do not use HPKE's encryption API. Instead, they are only interested in using key material (key, nonce) exchanged by HPKE, for external use?\r\n\r\nApplications should not use the `key` and `nonce` values computed by HPKE for such external uses. They should use [the secret export API](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke.md#secret-export) to generate them. This API allows domain separation of different uses with the `exporter_context` parameter. If an application needs multiple values (for example a key and a nonce), one exporter secret of sufficient length can be cut into two.\r\n\r\nI see that at least one question remains open, and that is: if the user only uses the secret export API and never the encryption API, which `aead_id` should be used in the `suite_id`? That's a good question. The single-shot secret export API was added only recently and this is certainly a question that has not been addressed so far. Thanks for pointing it out.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you could just use any valid AEAD ID supported by you HPKE implementation, and it does not matter which one (of course all parties involved in your protocol need to know which one). I agree for such use cases this ID seems superfluous and its arbitrary choice is error prone.\r\n\r\n@chris-wood @bifurcation Do you have an idea how to address this? Allowing the use of `0x00` if an application does not use the encryption API?",

I made a PR to show exactly what changes this would involve in the draft and it's been hanging there (by the way, the changes specified in the PR do not have all the test vector changes, but I will be happy to supply all of them if you agree to accept this PR but if you're going to reject this then there's no point). So allow me to raise this as an issue in the hope it elicits some discussion.\r\n\r\nThe NIST curves can be exchanged using \"compact representation\" per RFC 6090. That means just sending the x-coordinate. You don't even need to send a sign bit because the sign is not necessary since we're just doing Diffie-Hellman. This has the benefit of making Npk be the same as Nsk and Nsecret, just like the Bernstein curves. This makes the interface be a bit more uniform and cuts down on extraneous formatting (pre-pending with a 04, for instance). \r\n\r\nIn my implementation supporting compact representation I just do the equation of the curve and take the square root to get a y-coordinate (again, sign is irrelevant) in order to do the group operation. On the CFRG list Mike Hamburg mentioned that it's possible to do the x-only Montgomery ladder so even recovering y is not strictly necessary. \r\n\r\nI understand that there's no requirement on how one sends blobs of bits from one party to another and it's possible to do HPKE, get enc in the form of 04..x..y and then rip out x and send it to the other party who would, presumably reconstruct the 04..x..<either y> in order to pass it into HPKE but that's just horrible. The 04..x..y thing is a SECG-defined representation but there's really no reason to abide by that, especially when the 04 and the y-coordinate aren't needed.\r\n\r\nPlease consider accepting this PR. I'll be happy to finish the test vectors if you do.\r\n",

I just glanced at Kyber, Frodo, SIKE, NTRU, McElice, and SABER, and all of them return a non-null value on Decaps (notably, the last 3 do have failure conditions, but they output something pseudorandom when that condition is reached).\r\n\r\nAs for implicit failures, this is something that we have plenty of already. For example, X25519AuthDecap currently produces the wrong symmetric key if given the wrong sender pubkey, and this is only detectable at the AEAD stage. We could theoretically push the error to the Decap stage by including a test payload with every encapped key. This would perhaps let users catch Auth/PSK errors more easily, and also detect implicit failures due to (extremely low probability) correctness errors like in FrodoKEM. The downside is that this would increase the size of encapsulated keys by 112-150%.",

(While the spec does specify operations, how exactly that manifests in your programming language is necessarily an implementation question. There are many considerations around the type system, how you want to represent HPKE ciphers, naming, etc.)\r\n\r\nFirst, I don't think the X25519 zero-check is that controversial. TLS mandates it, so I expect any TLS-adjacent implementation to use it. It should stay. HPKE also supports P-256, where both point-at-infinity and point-on-curve checks are quite well-established. (And necessary! Missing the point-on-curve check has the usual implications with uncompressed coordinates. Even with compressed coordinates, not every compressed input successfully finds a square root. Missing the point-at-infinity check means the output secret is not even defined.)\r\n\r\nSecond, Encap and Decap can fail for every KEM. Even ignoring failures inside the KEM, most of our programming languages do not have sufficiently strong type systems to reject keys and enc values of the wrong length at the type level. Even where they are strong enough, that's just shifting the check to the caller. At the end of the day, your protocol probably sends a variable-length string somewhere. Or the KEM may need to serialize something in a way that doesn't span the whole `[N]byte` space.\r\n\r\nFinally, you'd need to shift the failure to not just decryption, but also encryption (if the recipient public key is wrong) and export. Those do not have as natural of error cases as decryption, so shifting the error seems more error-prone.",

(Though they do work very differently internally...)\r\n\r\nOne difference I can see is you're better off sticking your label string into `info` since other protocols might not be single-shot. (Is it worth a suggestion to incorporate a label string into `info`.) @chris-wood also points out that processing `aad` with your AEAD's universal hash function is likely faster than processing `info` with your KDF. So there's probably some benefit to keeping bulk data in the `aad` side of things. But I also expect this is negligible compared to the KEM. :-)\r\n\r\n Beyond that, I'm not sure. `aad` is per-encryption and `info` is per-context, but what \"feels\" per-encryption vs per-context is a little hazy for single-shot uses.\r\n\r\n(CC @csharrison)",

That's some weird kind of forward secrecy assuming that skR and psk are stored sufficiently separated (weird because new ciphertexts are still created with the same key material, there is no key update, no transition to a new epoch, etc). I have a proof for this property within my analysis. I think it's a good idea to mention this in the security considerations section, but maybe it's already implicit with my previous text suggestion.\r\n\r\nA protocol building upon HPKE could try to add better properties, but I am not sure if this would be out of scope of this draft?",

      "body": "The isolated DHKEM cannot be proven IND-CCA-secure as it is: In the current Encap, nothing is done with the result of the DH operation, `zz`. This means there is nowhere where the GDH assumption can be applied, as for this we need a comparison of a value with `g^ab` in the game, like `g^c = g^ab`, which we can then change in a game hop to `false`.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem when looking at HPKE as a whole, because `zz` is fed into Extract which we model as a random oracle. For DHKEM isolated, this problem can be fixed by feeding the Diffie-Hellman shared secret through another random oracle before returning the result as `zz`.\r\n\r\nThe hash functions suggested in this pull request are chosen to correspond to the security level of the elliptic curve DH, respectively. If users of HPKE want to use only one hash function, then they need to choose the KDF depending on the used DHKEM. Specifying each DHKEM for multiple (i.e. different output size) hash functions seems overkill and like sending wrong signals about the security level of DHKEM.\r\n\r\nRegarding random oracle cloning: By introducing another call to a random oracle, which might be implemented by the same hash function, this becomes now more relevant than before. I think we need to make sure that Hash' and the calls to Hash inside HMAC are independent, to be able to use the indifferentiability theorem on SHAxxx. I looked at the input domains of these two calls for SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 and they are indeed _already disjoint_ by their lengths. An open question is if we need to do something about the Hash calls `Hash(pskID)` and `Hash(info)` that we model as collision resistant. I like to discuss this with Bruno and/or Karthik before proceeding.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to keep you in the loop, please feel free to provide preliminary feedback.",

I don't think this conflicts with the stated goal.\r\n\r\nWe could also add the prefix to `secret`, it would have the same effect of binding HPKE's output secrets to the primitive name. In my view we chose to add the prefix to `context` because that's a place where we already add all the other context. Now that I am looking closer, the outputs of the three Expand calls are also not exposed by the protocol and thus can be considered intermediary values as well (`key` and `nonce` are used to produce ciphertexts, only those are exposed; `exporter_secret` is used to derive the actual exported secrets). That's why I would not comment on another intermediary value (secret), and drop this sentence.\r\n\r\nI think I can now express my weird feeling towards \u201cindependent\u201d better: the goal of binding the secrets to the primitive name is not assured by a security proof. I think we cannot prove that other protocols do not derive the same keys, because we do not have control over these other protocols. They could still derive the same keys on purpose. What we achieve by the `identifier` string is that the probability gets small that someone does it by accident. But we cannot get a guarantee like with `HashDH` and `Hash`, where we control both protocols. That's why I felt uncomfortable with \u201cindependent\u201d, because it suggests a more formal guarantee as it actually gives.",

(As a reminder: Arbitrary-sized input to Hash can lead to collisions with input to Hash calls inside HMAC. This would render the proof inapplicable that proves indifferentiability of HMAC from a random oracle. To avoid collisions, we use Extract calls and separate the input domains by using a prefix).\r\n\r\nTo avoid this extra Hash call inside HMAC, we can just anticipate it directly in KeySchedule, and thus control the prefix. While this introduces branching inside KeySchedule, this branching would either way be done inside HMAC. Doing the Extract call even if the PSK is shorter then Nb would hurt performance in non-PSK modes, too.",

          "body": "On the context added to DHKEM:\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, this is an ongoing effort to propose changes to the HPKE draft, with the goal to make DHKEM a KEM being provable IND-CCA-secure independently from HPKE as a whole.\r\n\r\nHaving DHKEM IND-CCA-secure on its own is nice because then it is enough to do _one_ proof of HPKE assuming an IND-CCA-secure KEM. If DHKEM would not be IND-CCA-secure, then we would need both an explicit proof of the entire HPKE[DHKEM] _and_ a proof of HPKE assuming an IND-CCA-secure KEM if we want other KEMs to be pluggable into HPKE.\r\n\r\n- As discussed earlier and off-channel, Curve25519 has equivalent keys. This results in a weaker security property for DHKEM in comparison to full HPKE, because DHKEM does not have any context so far in the derivation of zz.\r\n\r\n  The common recommendation is to include enc, pkRm, and pkSm into the context of the derivation of zz. Adding context to the Extract step of HKDF is not advisable as noted in the HKDF RFC [1]. This is why this update of the pull request adds an Expand step to DHKEM.\r\n\r\n  Curve25519 is specified not to have/need public-key validation, which is why equivalent keys \u201ccannot\u201d be detected beforehand. (Also, adding context is a lot cheaper than doing a scalar mult/point addition to detect equivalent keys).\r\n\r\n- Why not have more context within DHKEM: would it desirable to have kem_id, kdf_id, and a protocol-specific identifier in the context?\r\n\r\n  The goal of such context would be that, even if someone uses DHKEM with the same static keys in parallel with two different protocols (HPKE and some other protocol), the two DHKEM key distributions (of zz) are independent.\r\n\r\n  We came to the conclusion that to achieve this goal, DHKEM's key derivation needs to be protocol-dependent, for example by receiving as input an info variable that contains the protocol name, and use this in the context. (kem_id and kdf_id are not protocol-dependent but specific to DHKEM and thus are not useful to make the keys independent if the same DHKEM is used.)\r\n\r\n  Requiring an info parameter for DHKEM seemed to be rather complex in comparison to the benefit; also this benefit is rather uncontrollable because it involves assumptions on the well-behavior of other protocols. Also, the post-quantum KEMs don't seem to do that. We came to the conclusion to only make sure that enc, pkSm, pkRm are in DHKEM's context, because they are necessary to make it IND-CCA-secure on its own.\r\n\r\nLeft to discuss:\r\n- enc, pkSm, pkRm are now part of the context of both DHKEM and KeySchedule. It would be ok to _not_ include them in KeySchedule's context if HPKE would require from a KEM that public keys and the KEM ciphertext are included explicitly in the derivation of the KEM shared secret.\r\n\r\n[1] https://hyp.is/BEfR7m1AEeqBfpNgYg1Ivg/tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869",

This is the only place where we give an arbitrary-length bitstring as the first parameter to (Labeled)Extract, so maybe it's wasteful to have the branching every time (even for all the calls with 0 as first parameter)? If you say you prefer this to have a cleaner KeySchedule, I think I could agree.\r\n\r\nJust in case: Have you seen my earlier comment? It might have been buried within this long discussion, so let me cite:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/pull/50#issuecomment-603568796\r\n\r\n> On the PSK length:\r\n> \r\n> HMAC(K, M) feeds K through a call to Hash if K is longer than Hash's blocksize. If we allow arbitrary-size PSKs for user convenience, this would introduce another place where Hash is called on arbitrary-sized input, just like with info and pskID. (As a reminder: Arbitrary-sized input to Hash can lead to collisions with input to Hash calls inside HMAC. This would render the proof inapplicable that proves indifferentiability of HMAC from a random oracle. To avoid collisions, we use Extract calls and separate the input domains by using a prefix).\r\n> \r\n> To avoid this extra Hash call inside HMAC, we can just anticipate it directly in KeySchedule, and thus control the prefix. While this introduces branching inside KeySchedule, this branching would either way be done inside HMAC. Doing the Extract call even if the PSK is shorter then Nb would hurt performance in non-PSK modes, too.\r\n\r\n",

Then the adversary can use the decryption of the authenticated encryption as an oracle: it fails if the key is not correct.\r\n\r\nA quantum adversary could for example know all KEM keys of a classic (non-post-quantum) KEM, but not the PSK, and then mount this attack.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statement about low-entropy PSKs depends on the employed KDF algorithm. At this place in the spec, the definitions are still rather general. Only later it becomes obvious that HPKE is specified with HKDF and SHA2. HKDF's RFC clearly states that it is not designed to slow down dictionary attacks [1].\r\n\r\n[1] https://hyp.is/xAKxmG4hEeqyB5fD4eRdUQ/tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869",

Instead of transforming the Nh bytes default psk into another constant of length Nh bytes, using LabeledExtract, we can just not transform the default psk at all and use it directly. This removes the performance penalty for non-psk modes.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be that implementations pre-computed the transformed default psk value. This seems a stretch to me, as transforming the default psk does not buy anything in terms of provable security. If we assume that implementations specialize for one particular HPKE mode anyway, it also does not buy much in terms of reducing probability of implementation mistakes.",

This functionality is necessary in MLS (in order to have multiple participants derive their ancestor nodes' secret keys). I propose the use of `UnmarshalSk` to do precisely this.\r\n\r\n`UnmarshalSk` need not be a total function. In NIST curves, for example, the `Octet-String-to-Field-Element` function (defined in [SECG](https://secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf)) will return \"invalid\" for inputs that represent integers that are greater than or equal to the modulus. I haven't written it anywhere, but I would like to recommend that any end users who want to call `UnmarshalSk` on some deterministically derived bytes use a KDF chain to do rejection sampling.",

The problem is that `UnmarshalSk` is insufficient to provide a reliable way to generate a keypair. MLS should not have to rejection-sample a private key, as that might not work for some KEMs.\r\n\r\nInstead, I define the `DeriveKeyPair` function, which replaces `GenerateKeyPair`. This function \"knows\" how to reliably generate a private key, so MLS doesn't have to.\r\n\r\nIt works in the obvious way for the CFRG curves, and does rejection sampling for the NIST curves. The bitmask part is necessary because P-521 scalars are only 521 bits long. There's only 1 bit that can be legally set in the MSB. Without clearing the top 7 bits, the candidate key would be rejected with probability 254/256. This bitmask does not impact uniformity.\r\n\r\nFinally, rejection sampling 255 times has overwhelming probability of success. Of the curves above, the one with highest probability of candidate scalar rejection is P-256, with probability 2^(-32). The likelihood that this fails after 255 attempts is 2^(-8160).",

It may be overkill (I think in my original comment I said something like \"this is probably paranoia, but...\").\r\n\r\nThe kind of thing one might worry about without `GROUP` is a case where it's possible to confuse serialized elements of two different groups. In this case it *could* be possible to construct two exchanges with identical `kemContext` inputs. (Not clear that's enough to construct an attack, but we can completely rule out attacks of this kind by including `GROUP`.)",

The added label `kem_id` always has two bytes. I think the LabeledExtract call in ExtractAndExpand does not need to have `kem_id` as a label, because the intermediary value `dh` is never exposed. The important thing is that `zz` is explicitly bound to the scheme's name, and for that it is enough to have it in `kemContext`. (I think we had a similar reasoning when we decided what to include where in KeySchedule's context)",

The sender and receiver are nevertheless protected against forgeries by other parties. In the terminology of https://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/ec5c18b23b11d82c, crypto_box uses \"public-key authenticators\" rather than \"public-key signatures.\"\r\n\r\nUsers who want public verifiability (or receiver-assisted public verifiability) should instead use signatures (or signcryption).

Like label \u201cpsk_hash\u201d if we are computing `psk_hash`.\r\n\r\nI added labels for LabeledExtract inside DeriveKeyPair because these calls shall not collide with calls inside ExtractAndExpand. I am not really happy with \u201cdkp_prk\u201d (**D**erive**K**ey**P**air prk) but wanted it to be different from \u201cprk\u201d because that is already used inside ExtractAndExpand.

I touched this topic briefly in https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/pull/112#discussion_r442157565:\r\n\r\n \u201c[\u2026] binding to the [kem_id] plays a similar role as the RFCXXXX label which we do include in *both* LabeledExtract and LabeledExpand, even if the LabeledExtract results are never exposed. [\u2026] this is about [\u2026] that the calls are orthogonal, which makes it easier to reason with separate random oracles for separate ciphersuites (and DHKEM is kind of a sub-standard inside this RFC, so it makes sense to have RFCXXXX and the DHKEM group as a label).\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought about this again for a while today. I start thinking that we should just put the entire ciphersuite identifier as a label, along with \"RFCXXXX \". For a DHKEM, the \u201centire ciphersuite\u201d is only the `kem_id`, but for the remainder of HPKE, it is `kem_id`, `kdf_id`, `aead_id`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nciphersuite (KEM) = I2OSP(kem_id, 2)\r\n\r\nciphersuite (remainder) = concat(\r\n  I2OSP(kem_id, 2),\r\n  I2OSP(kdf_id, 2),\r\n  I2OSP(aead_id, 2))\r\n\r\ndef LabeledExtract(salt, label, IKM):\r\n  labeledIKM = concat(\"RFCXXXX \", ciphersuite, label, IKM)\r\n  return Extract(salt, labeledIKM)\r\n\r\ndef LabeledExpand(PRK, label, info, L):\r\n  labeledInfo = concat(I2OSP(L, 2), \"RFCXXXX \", ciphersuite, label, info)\r\n  return Expand(PRK, labeledInfo, L)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPackaging this into the KDF removes it as clutter from ExtractAndExpand and DeriveKeyPair, and would also simplify KeySchedule. So maybe this can unite advantages for both worlds: cleaner implementation, and good for proofs.\r\n\r\nI arrived here when thinking about why it is that we do not bind the following line to the ciphersuite:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(psk_hash, \"secret\", zz)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the 3 LabeledExpands in KeySchedule do have the ciphersuite within `key_schedule_context`, but then again the LabeledExpand in Context.Export does not have the ciphersuite explicitly. So again, just having the ciphersuite within LabeledExtract and LabeledExpand might make this all cleaner.",

      "body": "I would like to make an alternative proposition to #126, based on it.\r\n\r\nIn this proposition, `identifier` is used as implicit parameter to `LabeledExtract` and `LabeledExpand`. This can be justified because the document already assumes that `kem_id`, `kdf_id`, `aead_id` are implicitly encoded into the implementation. The advantage of having `identifier` implicit is that this removes clutter from the other function definitions; this might make implementation work easier because the calls to LabeledExtract and LabeledExpand then have fewer nested parameters.\r\n\r\nOn the question if `mode` should be in the identifier: if `mode` should be in the identifier, it is hard to let `identifier` be an implicit parameter, because the `mode` parameter is an explicit parameter (which is needed for `VerifyPSKInputs`). I thought about if we can find a reason why *not* including `mode` in the identifier is justified from a provable security point-of-view. I came to the conclusion this works out, because:\r\n\r\nThe first calls in `KeySchedule` are, from a variable dependencies point of view:\r\n```\r\n  psk_hash = LabeledExtract(zero(0), \"psk_hash\", psk)\r\n  secret = LabeledExtract(psk_hash, \"secret\", zz)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the following KDF calls include `mode` because it is in the `key_schedule_context`, so those are safe. Values of `secret` cannot collide between different modes, because:\r\n- `zz` is the same for the Base and PSK modes, but `psk_hash` is different for these modes (default_psk vs non-defaut)\r\n- `zz` is the same for the Auth and AuthPSK modes, but `psk_hash` is different for these modes (default_psk vs non-defaut)\r\n\r\nThis means we do not need to domain-separate by the mode in each call, because the two LabeledExtracts above already have a clear-enough dependency on the mode; which allows us to have `identifier` be implicit and have cleaner function definitions.",

These two possibly *different* KDFs that are both referenced with the *same names* `LabeledExtract` and `LabeledExpand` have been in the document since we added a KDF in the KEM. Adding `suite_id` just makes this possible confusion problem more apparent I guess. The test vectors will catch it at the end, but if we can make the confusion less likely, it would be nice for the developers.\r\n\r\nI am fond of the idea to leave `suite_id` implicit, because making it explicit will clutter the calls to `LabeledExtract` and `LabeledExpand`.

Yes, theoretically `aead_id` could collide with the labels `eae_prk` and `zz`. Not for the AEADs in the current document though: `hex(ord(\"z\"))` is `0x7a` and `hex(ord(\"e\"))` is `0x65`, and all current AEADs have 0s in the first byte.\r\n\r\nWe could have the `suite_id` for the KEMs be `concat(I2OSP(kem_id, 2), zero(4))` to avoid that forever.",

I did not check all the NIST candidates so see if others do something similar. Especially I did not look if someone does variable size public keys, like, an entire range of sizes. Do you think we need to accommodate for this more explicitly? I made a small note down in `IANA Considerations/KEM Identifiers`.\r\n- In SIKE, Encaps and Decaps always take uncompressed public keys as inputs, so the caller is supposed to do the decompression, if necessary.\r\n- We do already say explicitly that for P256, P384, P521, HPKE uses **un**compressed public key encoding. I guess that is due to the current of implementations? It seems for post-quantum KEMs it is interesting to leave both possibilities open, uncompressed and compressed, because some devices might not have the computation power to do (de)compression.\r\n\r\nNotes on security requirements:\r\n- I removed the explicit requirement that `enc`, `pkR`, `pkS` must be included into the context of the KEM's key derivation. What we need is IND-CCA2 security, and if a KEM has that without these in the context, that is completely fine.\r\n\r\nDONE:\r\n- see if RSA fits into this already, as mentioned in #84.\r\n- I did not yet look at the \u201crelationship between the private key and the public key\u201d as mentioned in #84.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- See if any NIST candidates have different encodings for KEM ciphertexts\r\n- Do the proofs for the new security notions and update the text accordingly.\r\n- use these new notions in the main Security Considerations text?\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome especially on:\r\n- is it good to make `OPTIONAL` all-caps for GenerateKeyPair, DeriveKeyPair, AuthEncap, AuthDecap?\r\n- different public key sizes: do you think the formulations work?\r\n- It occurred to me that KEM ciphertexts might as well also have different encodings.

      "body": "**Summary**:\r\n\r\nWhile working on formal composition proofs for HPKE, a problem for applicability of the proofs in a post-quantum setting came up. Here, composition proof means a proof of HPKE assuming some general abstracted KEM.\r\n\r\nThis pull requests proposes a small change to the `KeySchedule` which resolves this proof issue and at the same time simplifies KeySchedule by removing one call to LabeledExtract. After the change, the protocol would be cryptographically cleaner, and also a tiny bit faster, and one line less to implement.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `KeySchedule` contains the following computation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(psk_hash, \"secret\", shared_secret)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrequently, HKDF-Extract is modeled as a random oracle. However, we would like to avoid using the random oracle model in the remainder of HPKE (a.k.a. the DEM part/the non-KEM part) and instead use a standard model assumption like PRF. Then, the composition proof will much more likely stay valid in a quantum setting: someone proving once-and-for-all that some PRF is post-quantum secure seems much easier than specifically re-analyzing HPKE in a quantum random oracle model. (papers like [On Quantum Indifferentiability](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/257.pdf) suggest that quantum random oracles are a real headache.)\r\n\r\nAs a first guess, we would like to model the Extract call as a PRF, with its second parameter `shared_secret` being the key. However, LabeledExtract prefixes `shared_secret` with some labels, let's recall the definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef LabeledExtract(salt, label, ikm):\r\n  labeled_ikm = concat(\"HPKE-05 \", suite_id, label, ikm)\r\n  return Extract(salt, labeled_ikm)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means the value that goes into Extract as `labeled_ikm` is not from a uniformly random distribution. Thus, we cannot use a PRF assumption, because there is no uniformly random key. What's left would be a \"seedless extractor\" assumption, which only requires that there is enough entropy in the ikm. Such a seedless extractor is a pretty idealized object and thus morally very close to the random oracle assumption. Actually, the theorems justifying that HMAC is such an extractor usually use a random oracle assumption on an underlying compression function. This is unpleasant because this practically makes the HPKE composition proof rely on a random oracle assumption, which means this proof would not stay valid in a quantum setting.\r\n\r\n**The mitigation**: a mitigation would be to replace these two lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\npsk_hash = LabeledExtract(\"\", \"psk_hash\", psk)\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(psk_hash, \"secret\", shared_secret)\r\n```\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\n```\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(shared_secret, \"secret\", psk)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat resolves the issue for the proof, because: the first parameter goes directly into Extract's first parameter without prefix, and thus we could use a PRF assumption.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we get rid of hashing `psk` to `psk_hash`:\r\n- `shared_secret` does not exceed the block size of any of the KDFs specified in the RFC (`shared_secret` is at most 64 bytes long (for SHA512), and the block size of SHA256 is 64 bytes), so we don't need the hashing step to squeeze it below the block size.\r\n- in the second parameter of Extract, there is no length restriction to `psk`\r\n\r\nThis proposed change stays a valid use case of HKDF-Extract: we want to extract the entropy from the psk, and the psk is not necessarily from a uniform distribution (as we do not require that in the draft, and it would maybe too restrictive indeed). Also, HKDF-Extract does allow to use a salt that is secret and random.\r\n\r\nFrom a more global view point: In DHKEM, we already feed the DH shared secret through a random oracle (HKDF) to achieve a uniformly random value on the bitstrings of a fixed length, so it would be cryptographically cleaner to use this property in the following (by keying a PRF with it), instead of requiring a second random oracle.",

But now it's the `ikm`, which is passed to a `concat` call inside `LabeledExtract`, so we still have to dynamically allocate memory (or at least cap the size of the PSK, which might be reasonable for an implementation to do).\r\n\r\nSince the size of `shared_secret` *should* be fixed length (for all KEMs in this document), one thing we might consider is swapping the order arguments to LabeledExtract, e.g., \r\n\r\n```\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(psk, \"secret\", shared_secret)\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of this\r\n\r\n```\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(shared_secret, \"secret\", psk)\r\n```",

Don't know if that's still applicable.\r\n\r\nExtending on Chris' post on this aspect, he hit send first while I was still typing: From my cryptographic point of view, we introduced psk_hash to ensure that the first parameter of Extract is shorter than the underlying hash function's block size, which is necessary when modeling Extract as a random oracle. If we are no longer modeling _this_ Extract call as random oracle, this requirement is no longer applicable.\r\n\r\nshared_secret, as the new first parameter of Extract, has a fixed length for a fixed KEM; sizes vary between KEMs. I don't know if that's enough for implementations that need fixed length.\r\n\r\nI also recall that the fixed-size requirement was for the parameters of the concat call:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey_schedule_context = concat(mode, psk_id_hash, info_hash)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding Chris' proposal of doing\r\n```\r\nsecret = LabeledExtract(psk, \"secret\", shared_secret)\r\n```\r\nso basically just getting rid of the psk_hash: The cryptographic reasoning behind this pull request requires that shared_secret is the first parameter of LabeledExtract, otherwise it does not work. Said differently: We need the uniformly random value to be left as it is without labels. The third parameter of LabeledExtract is prefixed with labels, the first one is left alone. That's why we suggest to put shared_secret in the first parameter. shared_secret is the uniformly random value, psk just has high entropy, but is not uniformly random (and also is not there in all modes, and shared_secret is there in all modes).\r\n\r\n>     2. It's less important, but I wonder if we should revert the `psk_id_hash` and `info_hash` hashes as well.  Basically, those are trading hash invocations for `i2osp` calls and dynamic memory allocation.  (And this may be what the above-referenced review was focused on.)\r\n\r\nJust as a reminder: We are modeling Extract as a random oracle in the KEM, so we still cannot use Hash() directly.\r\n\r\nBut yes, if the fixed-size requirement is for some reason no longer applicable for the implementors who brought this up, then it would be fine for me to use a different injective encoding for the keyschedule_context. (Removed my example of `concat(mode, \"psk_id\", psk_id, \"info\", info)` because it is not injective, psk_id=\"info\", info=\"\" and psk_id=\"\", info=\"info\" result in the same bitstring)",

      "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for pushing this harder, but hear me out: this is better than the current workaround, which is making users carry the IKM they seeded their `DeriveKeyPair()` with.\r\n\r\n1. If a user literally ever uses `GenerateKeyPair()`, or uses `DeriveKeyPair()` and fails to save their IKM for any reason, they are badly and unnecessarily inconvenienced. They can continue to use their secret key for as long as their program runs, but they have no way to save the state of their own program.\r\n2. Ok, maybe a library anticipates this and decides to carry the IKM along with the secret key, or maybe it decides to expose some serialize/deserialize functionality that's compatible with everyone else using that library. Then great for that library! But should have something that _all_ libraries are guaranteed to do.\r\n3. This functionality is already implemented and exposed by `go-hpke` and `rust-hpke`, minus some validation checks.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate a point in 1, because I think it's a weird consequence of the current API: **if you use `GenerateKeyPair()`, you have no way to save your keypair.**\r\n\r\n# Specifics\r\n\r\n* I changed \"secret key\" to \"private key\" for consistency and because the latter is by far the more common term\r\n* I made the `SerializeSk()` routines canonicalize their outputs because 1. it's easy, and 2. users might have some unfounded expectations about equality of secret keys (\"I'll just check if this secret key is in my local database by doing a bytestring equality test\"). Canonicalizing makes these expectations true.\r\n* Aside for the purpose of canonicalization, I made the P-curve privkey serialization routine do a reduction mod `order` because SECG explicitly assumes that the secret key is an integer in the range `[0, order-1]`, but the HPKE spec makes no such assertion about P-curve privkeys\r\n* I made 0 an invalid secret key because there's literally no valid way to use a 0 secret key. Any DH op you do will produce the point at infinity, which MUST be treated as an error. So we may as well catch it as early as possible for easier debugging",

Basically, the change is that for the NIST curves the encapsulated public key is just the x-coordinate. That's what gets produced by Serialize() and that's what Deserialize() expects. As a result Nenc seemed kind of unnecessary so I got rid of it.\r\n\r\nI implemented this and the Diffie-Hellman shared secrets matched (as they should) but the kem_context is different so everything derived from the Diffie-Hellman secret is different. So new test vectors. Updating the test vectors is a PITA so I didn't do all of them but I will if you agree with this PR.",

DHKEM is \u201cperfectly correct\u201d, i.e. a valid encapsulation will be successfully decapsulated with probability 1. So, in some sense the analysis indeed assumes that there is no implicit error, but also it is not really an assumption, because we know that DH works that way.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest that we do not add this sentence here, but instead add a sentence two paragraphs further down, in the paragraph that discusses the composition theorems proved in the Eurocrypt paper:\r\n\r\n> Further, [ABHKLR20] proves composition theorems, showing that HPKE's Auth mode fulfills the security notions of authenticated public key encryption for all KDFs and AEAD schemes specified in this document, given any authenticated KEM satisfying the previously defined security notions for authenticated KEMs. **The theorems assume that the KEM is perfectly correct; it could easily be adapted to work with KEMs that have a non-zero but negligible probability for decryption failure.** The assumptions on the KDF are that Extract() and Expand() can be modeled as pseudorandom functions wherein the first argument is the key, respectively. The assumption for the AEAD is IND-CPA and IND-CTXT security.\r\n\r\nI will see if I can actually already adapt the composition proofs in CryptoVerif that way and will report back, but I think this is just a technical detail. It boils down to adding one game hop that turns the non-perfectly-correct KEM into a perfectly correct KEM, and accounting for the (negligible) probability that the adversary can detect this change.\r\n\r\nOn a related note: both analyses do _not_ explicitly model the all-zero/point-at-infinity check of the DH result. However, the theorems are valid for _both_ implementations that do or do not contain this check. (the reason is that it is predictable for the adversary if the DH result will be all-zero, and therefore the adversary could do this check itself before querying the KEM oracle)",

(This is basically calling `Encap` twice with the same entropy):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  dh1 = DH(skE, pkR1)\r\n  pkR1m = SerializePublicKey(pkR1)\r\n  kem_context1 = concat(enc, pkR1m)\r\n  shared_secret1 = ExtractAndExpand(dh1, kem_context1)\r\n\r\n  dh2 = DH(skE, pkR2)\r\n  pkR2m = SerializePublicKey(pkR2)\r\n  kem_context2 = concat(enc, pkR2m)\r\n  shared_secret2 = ExtractAndExpand(dh2, kem_context2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The adversary uses `KeySchedule` with `shared_secret1` and `shared_secret2` to compute the `key` and `base_nonce` for the two recipients.\r\n\r\n* Then, the adversary uses the Multi-Collide-GCM algorithm described in [LGR20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1491) to prepare a ciphertext that decrypts under both keys. Open problem: Multi-Collide-GCM takes in a set of keys and a _single_ nonce. Here, we have a different nonce per key. Is there a variant of Multi-Collide-GCM that works for a different nonce per key?\r\n\r\n* Assuming such a Multi-Collide-GCM exists, continue as follows: The adversary returns `(enc, ciphertext), pkR1, pkR2` (or the according identities belonging to the public keys) and wins the robustness game.\r\n\r\n",

In RFC5116 \"Authenticated Encryption\" tag length is deliberately not a separate external parameter to specify along with an AEAD cipher.

This relation MUST NOT\r\n   depend on external parameters, such as an authentication strength\r\n   parameter (e.g., authentication tag length).  That sort of dependence\r\n   would complicate the use of the algorithm by creating a situation in\r\n   which the information from the AEAD registry was not sufficient to\r\n   ensure interoperability.\r\n\r\nI suggest using the labels from the [IANA AEAD Algorithms](https://www.iana.org/assignments/aead-parameters/aead-parameters.xhtml) list, eg \"AEAD_AES_128_GCM\" instead of \"AES-128-GCM\", to have a precise reference to the algorithm, which includes all its parameters and details.\r\n\r\nI guess listing Nk, Nn, and even Nt is okay. They are a convenient summary of aspects of the AEAD alg without having to follow the references.

Semantically, that's probably what they should be. However, the rendering has no bullet points, which makes it kind of hard to read to me. Or maybe it is not the bullet points but the fact that `<code>` elements do _not_ have a slightly different color like in the rest of the document. What do you think?\r\n\r\nEdited to add: Looking at it again. In Section 3 \u201cNotation\u201d, I think it looks alright without bullet points. I guess it is the indentation in Section 4 that is confusing me. It makes it look a bit cluttered.\r\nI understand that the indentation was added to separate KEM, KDF, and AEAD. Is there another way? Making them subsections (that would make DHKEM as last subsection look a bit weird)? Or some kind of \u201cparagraph title\u201d, is that a thing?\r\n\r\nI see that the definition list below \u201cBeyond the above, a KEM MAY also expose the following functions\u201d is not indented. Should it be, to be consistent?",

The XML for that is arcane, so Martin Thomson and I added markdown support for essentially typing what you want, and with luck, kramdown-rfc knows what XML needs to be generated for that.  But that is only done if you put the \"Section ... of\" etc. into the {{..}}, to maintain  backward compatibility with existing documents.\r\n\r\n(I don't know, and didn't check here, if the RFC editor actually transforms old style references into section references; I just saw that at least one existing reference generates incorrect output so I fixed all of them -- triggered by the word \"section\" in the mail exchange :-)",
